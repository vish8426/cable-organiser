Workspace Organiser Design Project

## About
This team design project aims to create a product promoting the University of Sydneyâ€™s STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) faculties and is to be targeted at visitors and guests. The product is to be promoted through the item itself being on display or carried on the consumer.

The designing of the product will be carried out using software such as SolidWorks and exporting the file in CAD format for printing. The product itself is to be 3D printed using plastic material. Furthermore, the product must satisfy the requirements mentioned in sections below. A primary prototype is to be made modelling the future mass production of the item, if successful. In order to maximise sales, the item is to be sold at a lower price than other similar products on the market but still being profitable while accounting for manufacturing costs and profit margins.
